It is a playground on learning how to use neo4j, spring data and some recommendation engine sandbox. I followed a basic sample on how to use Spring Data Neo4j with Neo4j. Also I built a very simple recommendation engine based on neo4j-reco. 

Just go to the root of project and run:
mvn clean install
